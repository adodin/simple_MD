## Purpose
A simple MD engine in python for small scale local simulations. 
This is intended to provide a transparent view of how MD packages work as a pedagogical tool. 
It can also be used to generate simple demonstrative figures and animations for academic presentations and courses.
The package also proudly wears it's tortured contrived acronym on it's sleeve.
